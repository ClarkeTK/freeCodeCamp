# Build a Tribute Page

https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page

>**Objective:** Build a CodePen.io app that is functionally similar to this: https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/zNqgVx.
>
>Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
>
>You can use HTML, JavaScript, and CSS to complete this project. Plain CSS is recommended because that is what the lessons have covered so far and you should get some >practice with plain CSS. You can use Bootstrap or SASS if you choose. Additional technologies (just for example jQuery, React, Angular, or Vue) are not recommended for >this project, and using them is at your own risk. Other projects will give you a chance to work with different technology stacks like React. We will accept and try to >fix all issue reports that use the suggested technology stack for this project. Happy coding!

With this project I set out to make a tribute page to the great guitar maker & musician, Les Paul. As with all the projects in this section responsiveness is a key feature. I diverged from the example by going with a 2 column webpage. When viewed in a vertical browser it neatly collapses into a single column and the text and image sizing adjusts for smaller screens.
